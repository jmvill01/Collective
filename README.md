# Collective
Requested/Proposed by: David Alvarez/Joel Villamor
Developed by: Joel Villamor
V: 1.0.0


Abstract:
With the internship operating under a 6 month time constraint, my goal and coworker's 
goal is to ensure that my tools are properly delivered for usability long after I have 
left. This in mind, The Collective is meant to be the central application to access 
all software and tools that I have and will create throughout my time at Cabinetworks.

This will ensure the software's ease of access by all members who have it. Similarly, 
it will make for a versatile platform by which members are able to perform many 
operation critical actions.


Inputs/Outputs:
The Collective application is a central directory tool that has no functionality of 
its own besides offering a simple and intuitive way of accessing different 
applications. As such, the inputs that correspond with this tool correspond with the 
accompanying software (currently): color scheduler, and report filter. 

Read each applications corresponding Readme.md or txt file for clarifications on 
necessary inputs and outputs.
